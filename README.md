## Deep Dream Tutorial

This is a walkthrough of the Deep Dream code created by Google. In it you'll learn how to create Deep Dreams, 
Controlled Deep Dreams, and Controlled Video Deem Dreams. There will be a [blog post](http://www.kpkaiser.com)
to go along with this, and pull requests are welcomed.

The images within were all created or shot by me, and you are free to do with them as you wish.

To get it running:
```bash
$ ipython notebook
```

Enjoy.
